## 📊 Data Analysis on Restaurant Sales

### 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a **Restaurant Sales Dataset** to uncover insights about customer behavior, sales patterns, and business performance. Using Python libraries such as **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the analysis explores univariate, bivariate, and multivariate relationships across different features.

### ⚙️ Key Steps

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handled missing values, standardized column names, and ensured data consistency.
* **Univariate Analysis** – Distribution of customer ages, payment methods, and sales categories (histograms, pie charts, countplots).
* **Bivariate Analysis** – Explored relationships such as *Restaurant vs Payment Method*, *Total Sales vs Quantity*, *Customer Age vs Sales* using scatterplots, barplots, and boxplots.
* **Multivariate Analysis** – Compared multiple variables together (e.g., Restaurant Sales by Payment Method and Customer Demographics).
* **Correlation Analysis** – Identified numerical relationships with a heatmap to highlight key factors influencing sales.

### 📈 Insights

* Certain restaurants consistently generate **higher sales** compared to others.
* **Digital payments** are more widely adopted than cash, showing customer preference trends.
* Younger customers tend to have **higher order frequencies**, while middle-aged groups contribute to **larger order values**.
* Strong correlation observed between **Quantity ordered** and **Total Sales**.

### 🚀 Future Scope

* Develop **predictive models** to forecast sales trends.
* Build a **recommendation system** for customers based on purchase behavior.
* Create a **dashboard** to visualize sales performance in real time.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
* **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
